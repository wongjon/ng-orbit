Northrop Grumman Team Orbit, Multidisciplinary Design Program (MDP) at the University of Michigan College of Engineering. For further questions, reach out to NG-OrbitMDP2021@umich.edu.

## Overview
The goal of our project is to develop a concept of operations and design a prototype On-Orbit Augmentation Component (OAC) to install Roll-Out Solar Arrays (ROSAs) onto existing satellites.
- Software: Martha Johnston (mrjohn), Andrew Soong (asoong), Jonathan Wong (wongjon)
- Attachment: Brahm Landis (brahm), Rachel Li (rachrli), Dyllian Powell (dyllp), Rohan Valluri (rvalluri)
- Professor Nilton Renno
- Sponsor Mentors: Andy Kwas, Anthony DeCicco, Justin Kerr
